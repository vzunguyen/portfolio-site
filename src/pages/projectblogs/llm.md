description: A project that explores the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Lit
---
# Introduction
This project explores the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) using the LitGPT framework.
LitGPT is a lightweight and flexible framework for training and deploying LLMs, built on top of PyTorch. It provides a simple interface for working with various LLM architectures, making it easier to experiment with different models and configurations.

# Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for implementing the project.
- **PyTorch**: An open-source machine learning library used for building and training neural networks
- **LitGPT**: A framework for training and deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) built on top of PyTorch.
