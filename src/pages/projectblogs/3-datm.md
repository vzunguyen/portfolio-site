# Introduction
Day At The Market is a 3D adventure game developed using Unity and C#. The game
offers players an immersive experience as they navigate through a bustling market, completing various quests and interacting with NPCs.
# Development Process
The development of Day At The Market spanned over a year, during which I worked as an intern at Educational Network Group. The project involved several key stages:
- **Conceptualization**: Brainstorming game ideas, mechanics, and storyline.
- **Design**: Creating 3D models, textures, and animations for characters and environments.
- **Implementation**: Coding game mechanics, player controls, and NPC interactions using C# in Unity.
- **Testing**: Conducting playtests to identify and fix bugs, and improve gameplay experience.
- **Polishing**: Refining graphics, sound effects, and overall user experience.
# Technologies Used
- **Unity**: The primary game engine used for developing the game, providing tools for 3D rendering, physics, and animation.
- **C#**: The programming language used for scripting game mechanics and interactions within Unity.
# My Journey (Problems we faced and what I learned)
## Planning and Documentation
It was fundamental for us to plan out the tasks for each sprint (for this project, each sprint was 3 weeks long).
To fully utilised Jira and Confluence, we jumped in learning how to use these tools effectively for project management and documentation.

### Jira Automation
During this project, I gained interest with learning how to effectively use project management tools. I was playing around with Jira Automation Function where whenever I was creating a ticket/task, it will perform pre-defined actions such as assigning the task to a specific person, setting due dates based on the sprint end date, and adding labels based on the task type.

### Confluence for Documentation

## Version Control
Using Git and GitHub for version control was essential for collaboration within the team.
