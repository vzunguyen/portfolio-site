# Portfolio Site

## Welcome to my introduction of myself

This is a static website that serves as my portfolio. It showcases my skills, projects, and experiences.

P.s: This is my second portfolio website 👾. My first portfolio: [My first very simple portfolio website](https://github.com/vzunguyen/portfolio-website)

## What I'm using 🛠️

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - A static site generator
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs

## How I organised my project 📁

| ----------------- |------------------------------------------------------|
| `public/`        | Static assets and files that users can access to     |
| `src/components/` | Reusable UI components (e.g., ProjectCard, Contacts) |
| `src/pages/`      | Individual pages of the website                      |
